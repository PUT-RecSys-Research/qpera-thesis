## üìñ Abstract

This Master's thesis presents an in-depth analysis of three main families of recommendation algorithms (**collaborative filtering**, **content-based filtering**, and **reinforcement learning**). The evaluation focuses on their resilience to data-related stresses, resistance to anonymization, explainability, and the ethical risks associated with their implementation. This research is particularly relevant given the recently adopted **EU AI Act** and the **Omnibus Directive**. The project provides a framework for comprehensive, multi-dimensional evaluation of recommender systems across diverse datasets and domains.

## ‚ùì Research Questions

This research addresses the following key questions:

1.  **Robustness Analysis**: How do different recommendation algorithm families compare in terms of resilience to data anonymization and perturbation techniques?
2.  **Privacy-Personalization Trade-off**: What is the relationship between recommendation accuracy, personalization quality, and user privacy preservation for each algorithm family?
3.  **Explainability Assessment**: To what extent can each algorithm generate meaningful explanations for its recommendations, and how does this capability affect user trust and system transparency?
4.  **Ethical Risk Evaluation**: How can ethical risks associated with each recommender system be identified, measured, and mitigated in accordance with EU AI Act requirements?

## üî¨ Key Contributions

This framework provides a novel, unified platform for evaluating recommendation algorithms across multiple, often conflicting, dimensions. Our key contributions include:

-   **Comprehensive Evaluation Framework**: A standardized pipeline to evaluate algorithms across personalization, privacy, explainability, and robustness.
-   **Trade-off Quantification**: Systematic analysis of the performance degradation under privacy constraints and personalization adjustments.
-   **Cross-Domain Analysis**: Evidence-based guidelines for algorithm selection based on performance across different application domains (e-commerce, social media, entertainment).
-   **Reproducible Research**: An open-source implementation with MLflow tracking and containerization to ensure full reproducibility of our findings.
