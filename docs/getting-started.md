# Getting Started with QPERA

This guide will help you set up the QPERA framework, download the necessary datasets, and run your first experiments.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9+**
- **Conda** or **Miniconda**
- **Git**
- **Kaggle account** (for dataset downloads)

## üöÄ Quick Start (Recommended)

This is the fastest way to get started. The `quickstart` command automates the entire setup, download, and execution process.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PUT-RecSys-Research/qpera-thesis.git
    cd qpera-thesis
    ```

2.  **Configure Kaggle API:**
    This project requires the Kaggle API for downloading datasets.
    - Download your `kaggle.json` API token from your Kaggle account page.
    - For automated setup instructions, run:
    ```bash
    kaggle-autoconfig
    ```

3.  **Run the Quick Start command:**
    This command will install the environment, download all datasets, and run the full experiment suite.
    ```bash
    make quickstart
    ```
    After completion, you can view the results in the MLflow UI.

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Installation

For more control over the setup process, follow these steps.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PUT-RecSys-Research/qpera-thesis.git
cd qpera-thesis
```

### 2. Configure Kaggle API

- Download your Kaggle API key (`kaggle.json`) and place it in `~/.kaggle/`. For detailed instructions, run:

    ```bash
    make kaggle-setup-help
    ```
- Ensure your `kaggle.json` file is placed correctly.
### 3. Environment and Dependencies
```bash
# Create the conda environment from the environment.yml file
make install

# Activate the new environment
conda activate ppera-env

# Install the project package in editable mode
make setup
```

### 4. Verify Installation
```bash
# Run this command to ensure the package is installed correctly
make check-env
```

### 5. Download Datasets
```bash
# Download all datasets required for the experiments
make download-datasets
```
For more details, see the [Datasets Guide](datasets.md).

## üî¨ Running Experiments

Once the setup is complete, you can run experiments.

### Run the Full Suite
To execute all defined experiments across all datasets (Note: this will take a significant amount of time):
```bash
make run-all
```

## üìä Viewing Results

The framework uses MLflow to track experiments.

1.  **Start the MLflow UI:**
    ```bash
    make run-mlflow
    ```
2.  **Open your browser:**
    Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8080` to view experiment runs, parameters, and metrics.
